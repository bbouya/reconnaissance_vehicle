# reconnaissance_vehicle
In-depth convept of the yolo algo,

## Context of the problem:
we are wooking on a self-driving car, So Im going to build a car detection system. To collect data(in some sensor, camera) wich can take a picture of the car and in the output (car, truck)

## YOLO : 
YOLO is a popular algorthm because it achieves high accuracy whilts also being able to run in real-time, this algorithm 'only looks once' at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions.
